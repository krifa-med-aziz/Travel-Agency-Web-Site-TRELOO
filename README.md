## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For structuring the content.
- **CSS3**: For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript (ES6)**: For interactivity and dynamic content rendering.

## Known Issues
- **Bad Practice Warning**: Some parts of the JavaScript code use direct DOM manipulation and inline event listeners, which may not scale well for larger projects. Refactoring with a framework or better practices is recommended.
